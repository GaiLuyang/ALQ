# ALQ
This code contains the process of ALQ quantizer reproduction in federated learning.
See requirement.txt for environment configuration.  Run Fed_AVG_ALQ.py directly, which uses ALQ for SGD-based federated learning.  Run Fed_ADMM_ALQ.py directly, which will use ALQ for ADMM-based federated learning.
